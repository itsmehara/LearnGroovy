### 2. Basic Syntax

#### Overview
Groovy is known for its simplicity and conciseness. Understanding the basic syntax is crucial as it forms the foundation for writing effective Groovy code. Below are detailed examples covering various aspects of Groovy's basic syntax.

#### Basic Syntax Examples

1. **Hello World**

```groovy
println 'Hello, World!'
```

Explanation: This is the simplest Groovy script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console using `println`, which is a shorthand for `System.out.println`.

2. **Variables**

```groovy
def name = "Groovy"
println "Hello, $name!"
```

Explanation: `def` is used to define a variable without specifying its type. Groovy supports string interpolation with the `$` symbol.

3. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**

```groovy
def a = 10
def b = 5

println "Addition: ${a + b}"
println "Subtraction: ${a - b}"
println "Multiplication: ${a * b}"
println "Division: ${a / b}"
```

Explanation: Groovy supports standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `${}` syntax is used for embedding expressions within strings.

4. **Conditional Statements**

```groovy
def number = 10

if (number > 0) {
    println "$number is positive"
} else if (number < 0) {
    println "$number is negative"
} else {
    println "$number is zero"
}
```

Explanation: Groovy uses the familiar `if-else` structure for conditional logic. The code checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the appropriate message.

5. **Looping**

```groovy
for (i in 1..5) {
    println "Number: $i"
}
```

Explanation: Groovy supports range operators (`..`) for defining loops. This loop iterates from 1 to 5, printing each number.

6. **Switch Statement**

```groovy
def number = 2

switch (number) {
    case 1:
        println "One"
        break
    case 2:
        println "Two"
        break
    case 3:
        println "Three"
        break
    default:
        println "Unknown number"
}
```

Explanation: Groovy's `switch` statement is similar to Java's. It matches the value of `number` against different cases and prints the corresponding message.

7. **Ternary Operator**

```groovy
def age = 20
def result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor"
println result
```

Explanation: Groovy supports the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions. This example checks if `age` is 18 or older and assigns "Adult" or "Minor" to `result` accordingly.

8. **Elvis Operator**

```groovy
def name = null
def displayName = name ?: "Unknown"
println displayName
```

Explanation: The Elvis operator (`?:`) is a shorthand for the ternary operator when dealing with `null` values. If `name` is `null`, `displayName` will be "Unknown".

9. **Default Parameters in Methods**

```groovy
def greet(name = "Guest") {
    println "Hello, $name!"
}

greet("John")
greet()
```

Explanation: Groovy allows default values for method parameters. If no argument is passed, the default value ("Guest" in this case) is used.

10. **String Manipulation**

```groovy
def str = "Groovy"
println str.toUpperCase()
println str.toLowerCase()
println str[0..2]
println str - "vy"
println "Hello".center(10, '*')
```

Explanation: Groovy provides various methods for string manipulation. This example demonstrates converting to upper/lowercase, substring extraction, removing a substring, and centering a string.


#### Variables and Types
Groovy is dynamically typed but also supports static typing.

```groovy
def name = "Groovy"  // Dynamic typing
String language = "Groovy"  // Static typing
int year = 2023
println "Name: $name, Language: $language, Year: $year"
```

#### Basic Operators
Groovy supports all standard arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

```groovy
def a = 10
def b = 5
println "Addition: ${a + b}"
println "Subtraction: ${a - b}"
println "Multiplication: ${a * b}"
println "Division: ${a / b}"
println "Modulus: ${a % b}"
```

#### Control Structures
Groovy uses control structures similar to those in Java, with some enhancements.

- **If-Else**:
  ```groovy
  def num = 10
  if (num > 0) {
      println "$num is positive"
  } else if (num < 0) {
      println "$num is negative"
  } else {
      println "$num is zero"
  }
  ```

- **Switch**:
  ```groovy
  def x = 2
  switch (x) {
      case 1:
          println "x is one"
          break
      case 2:
          println "x is two"
          break
      default:
          println "x is unknown"
  }
  ```

- **For Loop**:
  ```groovy
  for (i in 1..5) {
      println "Iteration $i"
  }
  ```

- **While Loop**:
  ```groovy
  def count = 1
  while (count <= 5) {
      println "Count is $count"
      count++
  }
  ```
#### Conclusion

Understanding the basic syntax of Groovy is essential for writing effective code. These examples cover fundamental aspects such as variables, control structures, operators, and string manipulation, providing a solid foundation for further exploration of the Groovy language.
