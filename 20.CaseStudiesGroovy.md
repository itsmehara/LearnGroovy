### 20. Case Studies and Real-world Applications

#### Building Web Applications with Groovy and Grails

1. **Creating a Grails project**

```bash
grails create-app myapp
```

2. **Defining domain classes**

```groovy
// grails-app/domain/Book.groovy
class Book {
    String title
    String author
}
```

3. **Generating controllers and views**

```bash
grails generate-all Book
```

4. **Running the Grails application**

```bash
grails run-app
```

5. **Accessing the application in a web browser**

```text
Open http://localhost:8080/myapp/books in your web browser to access the application.
```

6. **Implementing business logic in services**

```groovy
// grails-app/services/BookService.groovy
class BookService {
    def listBooks() {
        Book.list()
    }
}
```

7. **Handling form submissions**

```groovy
// grails-app/controllers/BookController.groovy
class BookController {
    def save() {
        def book = new Book(params)
        if (book.save()) {
            redirect action: "index"
        } else {
            render view: "create"
        }
    }
}
```

8. **Deploying the Grails application**

```bash
grails war
```

By exploring these case studies and real-world applications, 
you'll gain insights into how Groovy and its ecosystem are utilized in practical scenarios. 

You can apply these learnings to your own projects and understand best practices for building robust applications with Groovy.
