### 4. Closures

#### Overview
Closures are a powerful feature in Groovy that allow you to encapsulate a block of code and pass it around as an object. They are similar to lambdas or anonymous functions in other languages. Closures can capture variables from their surrounding scope, making them extremely flexible and useful in various contexts.

#### Closure Examples

1. **Basic Closure Syntax**

   ```groovy
   def greet = { name -> println "Hello, $name" }
   greet("World")
   ```

   Explanation: This is a simple closure that takes one parameter (`name`) and prints a greeting message.

2. **Closure with Implicit Parameter**

   ```groovy
   def printSquare = { println it * it }
   printSquare(4)
   ```

   Explanation: If a closure takes only one parameter, you can omit the parameter list, and the parameter is implicitly named `it`.



3. ** Defining Closures
   ```groovy
   def greet = { println "Hello, Groovy!" }
   greet()
   ```

4. ** Passing Parameters to Closures
   ```groovy
   def greet = { name -> println "Hello, $name!" }
   greet("Alice")
   ```

5. ** Returning Values from Closures
   ```groovy
   def square = { it * it }
   println square(4)
   ```


6. **Closure Returning a Value**

   ```groovy
   def square = { it * it }
   def result = square(5)
   println result
   ```

   Explanation: This closure returns the square of its input. The result is stored in a variable and then printed.

7. **Closure with Multiple Parameters**

   ```groovy
   def sum = { a, b -> a + b }
   println sum(3, 4)
   ```

   Explanation: This closure takes two parameters and returns their sum.

8. **Using Closures with Collection Methods**

   ```groovy
   def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   def squares = numbers.collect { it * it }
   println squares
   ```

   Explanation: The `collect` method is used to transform each element in a list using the given closure.

9. **Closures with Default Parameters**

   ```groovy
   def greet = { name = "Guest" -> println "Hello, $name" }
   greet("Alice")
   greet()
   ```

   Explanation: This closure has a default parameter value of "Guest". If no argument is provided, it uses the default value.

10. **Closures and Variable Scope**

   ```groovy
   def outerVariable = "I'm outside!"
   def closure = {
       def innerVariable = "I'm inside!"
       println outerVariable
       println innerVariable
   }
   closure()
   ```

   Explanation: Closures can access variables from their surrounding scope (outerVariable) as well as their own internal variables (innerVariable).

11. **Closures as Method Parameters**

   ```groovy
   def executeClosure(closure) {
       closure()
   }

   executeClosure { println "Closure executed!" }
   ```

   Explanation: This example demonstrates passing a closure as a parameter to a method and executing it within the method.

12. **Currying Closures**

   ```groovy
   def multiply = { a, b -> a * b }
   def double = multiply.curry(2)
   println double(5) // Outputs 10
   ```

   Explanation: Currying allows you to fix a parameter of a closure, creating a new closure with fewer parameters.

13. **Using `delegate` in Closures**

    ```groovy
    class Greeter {
        String name
        def greet() {
            println "Hello, $name"
        }
    }

    def closure = {
        name = "Alice"
        greet()
    }

    def greeter = new Greeter()
    closure.delegate = greeter
    closure()
    ```

    Explanation: The `delegate` property allows the closure to access and modify properties and methods of the assigned delegate object.

14. **Closure in Groovy's `each` Method**

    ```groovy
    def list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    list.each { println it }
    ```

    Explanation: The `each` method iterates over the list, executing the closure for each element.

15. **Using Closure with `findAll`**

    ```groovy
    def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    def evenNumbers = numbers.findAll { it % 2 == 0 }
    println evenNumbers
    ```

    Explanation: The `findAll` method filters the list based on the condition provided in the closure.

16. **Sorting with Closures**

    ```groovy
    def names = ["Tom", "Jerry", "Mickey", "Donald"]
    def sortedNames = names.sort { it.length() }
    println sortedNames
    ```

    Explanation: The `sort` method uses the closure to determine the sorting order, in this case by the length of the names.

17. **Using Closure for Lazy Evaluation**

    ```groovy
    def lazyClosure = { println "Evaluating"; 42 }
    def value = lazyClosure
    println "Before calling closure"
    println value()
    ```

    Explanation: Closures can be used for lazy evaluation, where the code inside the closure is not executed until the closure is called.

18. **Combining Closures**

    ```groovy
    def multiply = { a, b -> a * b }
    def add = { a, b -> a + b }
    def combined = { a, b, c -> multiply(add(a, b), c) }
    println combined(2, 3, 4) // Outputs 20
    ```

    Explanation: Closures can be combined to create more complex functionality. Here, `combined` uses both `multiply` and `add`.

19. **Closure with Optional Parameters**

    ```groovy
    def greet = { String greeting, String name = "Guest" -> println "$greeting, $name" }
    greet("Hello", "Alice")
    greet("Hi")
    ```

    Explanation: This closure has an optional parameter `name` with a default value. If no value is provided, it uses "Guest".


20. ** Closure Delegation Strategies
Closures in Groovy have a delegate object that can be used to change the scope of the closure.

```groovy
class Person {
    String name
    void greet() {
        println "Hello, my name is $name"
    }
}

def closure = {
    greet()
}

Person p = new Person(name: 'John')
closure.delegate = p
closure()
```

21. ** Closures with Collections
Closures are heavily used in Groovy collections for operations like `each`, `find`, `collect`, etc.

```groovy
def numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.each { println it }
def evenNumbers = numbers.findAll { it % 2 == 0 }
println "Even Numbers: $evenNumbers"
def squares = numbers.collect { it * it }
println "Squares: $squares"
```

22. ** Closure Currying
Currying allows you to fix a number of arguments in a closure.

```groovy
def multiply = { a, b -> a * b }
def multiplyBy2 = multiply.curry(2)
println multiplyBy2(5)  // Output: 10
```

#### Conclusion

Closures are a versatile and powerful feature in Groovy, enabling concise and expressive code. Understanding and effectively using closures can greatly enhance your Groovy programming experience. The above examples cover a wide range of use cases, demonstrating how closures can be utilized in different contexts.
Closures are anonymous code blocks that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from methods.
