## I am very happy to help you get started with Groovy! 

##### Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed, and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity. 

##### It can be used both as a scripting language and as a language for building applications.
